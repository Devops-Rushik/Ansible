# Ansible
Ansible is an open source IT automation engine and configuration management tool to automate tasks such as provisioning, applicaiton deploying and managing infrastrucure across different environments.

Ansible is an agentless architecture that means no need to install any package or agent on the managed nodes.

For automating Linux and Windows servers, Ansible connects to the managed nodes through SSH and pushes out Ansible modules to them. These modules are written to be resource models of the desired state of the system. Ansible then executes these modules over SSH and deletes them when finished. These modules are designed to be idempotent so that they only make changes to a system when necessary.

For automating network devices and other IT appliances where modules cannot be executed, Ansible runs on the control node. Since Ansible is agentless, it can still communicate with devices without requiring an application or service to be installed on the managed node.

# Inventory
Ansible inventory file is a fundamental component of Ansible that defines the nodes that you want to manage and the groups those nodes belong to. The inventory file can be static (a simple text file) or dynamic (generated by a script). It provides Ansible with the information about the nodes to communicate with during its operations.
